The `rtlsdr.dll` was downloaded from [librtlsdr/librtlsdr](https://github.com/librtlsdr/librtlsdr) on Github.
The .def file was created manually from the output of dumpbin and the .lib was created with the lib command, see [Using libmpv in Rust](https://connorcode.com/writing/tutorial/using-libmpv-in-rust#windows) for more information on the process.
