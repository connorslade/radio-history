# radio-history

Records and transcribes FM radio broadcasts so you can look back at any messages you missed.

Uses a RTL-SDR for input and whisper.cpp for speech recognition.
Download the needed whisper.cpp model from [here](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/blob/master/models/README.md) and view the build instructions [here](https://github.com/tazz4843/whisper-rs/blob/master/BUILDING.md).
